Post project thoughts
This was a fun and very interesting project. It forced me to wrap my head around recursion. A node is a very simple thing, and leads to some very powerful structures. The fact that I had already done the linked-list project really helped. I found that this was easier and I was able to power through this completely on my own. If I hadn't worked with linked lists before that wouldn't have been possible.
